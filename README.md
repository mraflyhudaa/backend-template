# Backend Template: Node.js with Express and MongoDB

This backend template is designed to provide a solid starting point for Node.js applications, integrating Express for server operations, MongoDB for data persistence, Winston for logging, and tools like Prettier, ESLint, and Husky to ensure code quality and consistency.

## Features

- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **MongoDB**: A document-based NoSQL database ideal for modern web applications.
- **Mongoose**: An elegant mongodb object modeling for Node.js that provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model your application data.
- **Winston**: A versatile logging library for Node.js designed for simplicity and universality.
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that supports many languages and integrates with most editors.
- **ESLint**: A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code.
- **Husky**: Modern native Git hooks made easy, improving your commits and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or newer)
- npm (v6.x or newer)
- MongoDB (Local or Atlas)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mraflyhudaa/backend-template.git
cd backend-template
```

2. Install dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

3. Setup environment variables:

Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`, then edit it with your settings.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Start the development server:

```sh
yarn run dev
```

This will start the server on `localhost` with the port specified in your `.env` file (default is 3000).

## Scripts

- `yarn run dev`: Runs the server in development mode with hot reloading.
- `yarn start`: Runs the server in production mode.
- `yarn run lint`: Lints the project files using ESLint.
- `yarn run lint:fix`: Fixes linting errors automatically, where possible.
- `yarn run format`: Formats code using Prettier.

## Husky Setup

Husky is used to enforce code standards and run scripts before committing. Set up Husky by running:

```sh
npx husky install
```

Then, add pre-commit hooks as needed, for example:

```sh
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm run lint"
```

This README template covers the essential sections, including an overview of the stack, getting started instructions, a description of available scripts, and guidance on contributing to the project. It assumes the presence of a `.env.example` file for environment variables and provides a placeholder for Docker support, which can be customized based on your project's needs.
